	      <p>This slide-deck was created for Coast Cards within Enactus SFU. This was a created within 4 weeks for a competition where teams of students present community outreach projects and business ventures to a judging panel of business leaders.</p>

	      <h2>Goal:</h2>
	      <p>Coast Cards is a social enterprise that employs people who have overcome addiction to upcycle used coasters into beautiful, handmade greeting cards. The team also partnered with John Volken Academy, the largest recovery centre in Western Canada to create transitional, part-time work opportunities for recovering addicts. The project currently employs five recovering addicts from the John Volken Academy, earning $12/hour.</p>

        <h2>Role:</h2>
	      <p>As a designer, I had to keep in mind the values of Coast Card. I used warm earthy-tones to encompass what Coast Cards is, and used a clean white as the contrast for the important text/imageries.</p>

        <p>Mini animations were used to emphasize the significance of the message, and I had to be aware of how it is placed to avoid the clashing of the animation with the video playing in the background.</p>

        <h2>Tools Used:</h2>
        <p>For this slide deck, I created it using Powerpoint as it was a software that was easily accessible by the members in my group. Premiere Pro was used for video editing, and the animations were enabled through Powerpoint as well.</p>
