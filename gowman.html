					<h2>ART DIRECTOR</h2>
					<p>I contributed with the art direction of the narrative angle that showcases David's story of tying in community through hand-crafted wooden instruments. This then led to my role as a cinematographer, where I made sure that David's values are shown in the documentary.</p>

					<h2>EDITOR</h2>
					<p>I was also in charge of recording the audio, editing the sequence of the video as well as colour-correcting the film to achieve a mood fitting to David's story. The program used to edit this documentary is Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>

	      <h2>PROCESS:</h2>
	      <p>Each week we revised our narrative and confided with David in regards to the story that he wants to share. David is a horn-maker that is passionate about bringing together the community in Maclean Park through his very own Oncle Hoonki's Fabulous Horn-shop.</p>

				<h2>THEME:</h2>
				<p>In order to capture David’s angle, we had to conduct multiple interviews to curate a narrative that showcases his story and how his role in the community came about. Through these interviews, we then pieced together the main theme that we wanted to focus on, which then led to the final interview. With the narrative completed, we filmed scenes from different events that David participated in, to capture moments that ties back in with his angle.</p>
