	        <p>This is a three week project that focused on developing a new feature on an existing application.</p>

	        <h2>Proposal:</h2>
	        <p>An addition to Instagram's explore page where the user creates their own category through Instagram's Collection feature to filter what they want to see.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Instagram's Business Goal:</h2>
	        <p>Instagram wants to maximize the amount of time a user interacts with their app. The more delightful the content, the more people want to stay on it, meaning that if users have some control over what they see in Explore page, that will entice them to use it for longer and and come back to Instagram more often.</p>

	        <h2>Insight + Opportunity:</h2>
	        <p>Through user-testing, we found out that the new algorithm on Instagram is causing  frustrations as users are not being able to view the content they want to see first. This was an opportunity for us to add onto this feature, allowing users  to control their needs first and  have the rest of the content follow Instagram's algorithm. </p>

	        <h2>Persona:</h2>

				<section class="section">
	        <p>For the persona, who chose someone who is deeply active on social media, and is always up to date on current news</p>
	        <p>Her frustrations on Instagram includes not being to browse content to her liking, as there is a constant amount of overly saturated Instagram generated content</p>
	        <p>Our proposal will be able to provide the user with their own personal curated content that is related to their collection, allowing them to have a say in what they see in the Explore Page </p>
	      </section>

	      <section class="section">
	        <h2>Process:</h2>
	        <p>We proposed three different features that could possibly target this opportunity. </p>

	        <p>This included the toggle filter for the Explore page, a main feed order, as well as an incognito mode. </p>

	        <p>Through user-testing and interviews, I concluded that users are not interested in an incognito mode, as that will go against what Instagram's main purpose is. </p>

				<section class="section">
	        <p>The main feed order is also not a huge priority as it seems that users are still scrolling through their feed regardless of the algorithm. With the toggle filter for the Explore page, I found out that users are interested in seeing content that they prefer to see, based on what they are already viewing. </p>

	        <p>This lead to my founding of a new problem, which was that when users click on something on accident, their whole Explore feed refreshes to new content based on this action. Our solution is the filter option for the Explore page, meaning that the users are able to choose self-created categories to explore.</p>

	        <h2>Final Reflections:</h2>
	        <p>This project allowed my partner and I to tie together the connection with business with design, and to narrow down user needs and what their desired end goal is. Moving forward, further user-testing can help determine if the placement of our implemented feature is most ideal, or if it should be placed in the collection tab instead. </p>
