	        <h1>MEDIC: UX/UI</h1>
	        <p>MEDIC is an application that provides users with the tool to find nearby medical clinics which displays their distance, wait times, medical expenses, and languages provided. There is also a patient history feature that allows users to input their medical history and to view their upcoming appointments.</p>

	        <p>This was a 6 week project for an Interface Design course.</p>

	        <h2>Role:</h2>
	        <p>Research and Strategy, User Experience, User Interface</p>

	        <h2>Problem:</h2>
	        <p>High proportion of patients go to local emergency department instead of their local clinics because they do not have a family doctor or cannot get a timely medical appointment.</p>
	        <p>“Providing them with the ability to book, change and cancel appoints help patients save a tremendous amount of time (only 11% of hospital designed apps have this feature)” -Michael Scranton, 2017</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Insight 1:</h2>
	        <p>Patients and consumers are now especially disadvantaged when it comes to the lack of transparency around the price and cost of healthcare products and services.</p>
	        <p>“As costs increase, market proponents should insist that consumers have access to comparative information, the price and cost of the products or services compared, and an analysis of the possible scenarios relevant to their purchasing decision.” - Institute of Medicine (US) Roundtable on Evidence-Based Medicine, 2010</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Insight 2:</h2>
	        <p>Requesting a copy of medical record from their former physician generally takes 30 working days from the date of request.</p>
	        <p>“81% of physicians said they believe EHRs [Electronic Health Record] improve access to clinical data more than two-thirds said an EHR can actually improve patient care” -Athena Health, 2017</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
	        <p>This application is targeting international patients as it provides them with the information they would need to get medical help as soon as possible, and aids in streamlining the diagnosis process at the doctor’s office.</p>

					<p>I started off with low-fi sketches of the map interface and clinic information, where I was mapping out the placement of the map, the user flow and how the users will see the interactions through animations</p>

				<section class="section">
					<p>I focused on the map interface of the application, where I made some rough wireframes to visualize where the map and the information features will be placed</p>

				<section class="section">
					<p>For the styleguide, the font Source Sans Pro was chosen as a sans-serif font is ideal for readability, and the slightly condensed letter forms make it ideal for displaying information where space is a concern</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
					<p>With the colour scheme, the goal was to create a welcoming and less intimidating tone, which is why we chose the bright colours	</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
					<p>The user will know which buttons on the interface is interactive through the colour changes</p>

	        <p>From user testing 5 people, we found out specific interfaces that needed changes:</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Map Interface:</h2>
	        <p>Browse clinic button doesn’t communicate tapability </p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Booking appointment interface: </h2>
	        <p>No editing of information directly on the overview page</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Patient profile interface:</h2>
	        <p>Unsure of who this page is for and what purpose it serves. Icon seems random and out of place</p>

	        <p>From these findings, I refined the searching interactions that the users can go through.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Map Interface:</h2>
	        <p>The users can now tap on the pinned icon within the map to swipe through information. The search bar provides a drop-down list of the available clinics near-by. The browse clinic button now displays a list view of the available clinics for faster readability, and is given a drop-shadow to stray away from flat design. </p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Booking Appointment interface:</h2>
	        <p>Users can now edit their information directly on the Appointment Overview page without having to access the previous pages.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
	        <h2>Patient History</h2>
	        <p>Previously named Patient Profile, it has now become a feature that focuses on the user's medical history as well as viewing or editing their upcoming appointments.</p>

	        <h2>Final Reflections:</h2>
	        <p>This project allowed myself to further understand how to incorporate the target user’s needs into an application. Figuring out the most important functionality that the users need in order to create value for this application helped pushed this forward.</p>
