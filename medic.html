	        <h1>MEDIC: MEDICAL MOBILE APPLICATION</h1>
				</section>

				<section class="section">
					<p>MEDIC is an application that provides users with the tool to find nearby medical clinics which displays their distance, wait times, medical expenses, and languages provided. There is also a patient history feature that allows users to input their medical history and to view their upcoming appointments.</p>

	        <!-- <p>This was a 6 week project for an Interface Design course.</p> -->

	       	<h2>ROLE:</h2>

	        <p>Research and Strategy, User Experience, User Interface</p>

					<p>My role was to design the flow of the application through a series of sketching, wireframing & mockups (Sketch) as well as the interactions (Principle).This was done along with two other team members. My focus included the onboarding as well as the map interface. </p>

						<p>How can we create an application that will reduce the cognitive overhead that the user faces when seeking medical attention internationally.</p>

		        <h2>INSIGHT 1:</h2>
		        <p>Patients and consumers are now especially disadvantaged when it comes to the lack of transparency around the price and cost of healthcare products and services.</p>

					<div class="right-50">
		        <h2>INSIGHT 2:</h2>
		        <p>Requesting a copy of medical record from their former physician generally takes 30 working days from the date of request.</p>

	        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
	        <p>This application is targeting international patients as it provides them with the information they would need to get medical help as soon as possible, and aids in streamlining the diagnosis process at the doctor’s office.</p>

					<p>I started off with low-fi sketches of the map interface and clinic information, where I was mapping out the placement of the map, the user flow and how the users will see the interactions through animations</p>

						<h2>FONT:</h2>
						<p>For the styleguide, the font Source Sans Pro was chosen as a sans-serif font is ideal for readability, and the slightly condensed letter forms make it ideal for displaying information where space is a concern</p>

					<div class="right-50">
						<h2>COLORS:</h2>
						<p>With the colour scheme, the goal was to create a welcoming and less intimidating tone, which is why we chose the bright colours.The user will know which buttons on the interface is interactive through the colour changes</p>

						<p>From user testing 5 people, we found out specific interfaces that needed changes:</p>

		        <h2>Map Interface:</h2>
		        <p>Browse clinic button doesn’t communicate tapability </p>

		        <h2>Booking appointment interface: </h2>
		        <p>No editing of information directly on the overview page</p>

		        <h2>Patient profile interface:</h2>
		        <p>Unsure of who this page is for and what purpose it serves. Icon seems random and out of place</p>

		        <p>From these findings, I refined the searching interactions that the users can go through.</p>

	        <h2>FINAL REFLECTIONS:</h2>
	        <p>This project allowed myself to further understand how to incorporate the target user’s needs into an application. Figuring out the most important functionality that the users need in order to create value for this application helped pushed this forward.</p>
