	      <p>This project is an addition to the existing Tribeca Film Festival application that extends the screening experience beyond the theatre to explore the diverse urban establishments of Manhattan.</p>

	      <h2>Tribeca Fim Festival</h2>
	      <p>Tribeca Film Festival was founded in 2002 in response to the 9/11 tragedy, serving the purpose of healing the “loss of vitality” in the Tribeca neighbourhood in Lower Manhattan. This annual multi-day festival aims to bring independent film to the widest possible audience, attracting up to 150,000 attendees each year.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
        <h2>Problem:</h2>
	      <p>1. The lack of a long-term vision resulted into an inconsistent identity, and the absence of a unique value proposition hindered their ability to differentiate from other film festivals.</p>

        <p>2. Chasing new technology and media projects is not a sufficient differentiator from competing festivals.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
	      <h2>Opportunity:</h2>
	      <p>To use Tribeca Film Festivals’s connection to the Tribeca neighbourhood as a unique selling proposition, bringing back the festival’s original mission of revitalizing the Lower Manhattan community.</p>

        <h2>Insight 1:</h2>
        <p>On average, film festival attendees visit one venue per day and do it with other people - Vancouver International Film Festival</p>

        <p>There is a disconnect between the screening and the actual festival in the sense that it feels like you’re just attending a regular movie. You line up to get in, watch the film, then move on.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
        <h2>Insight 2:</h2>
        <p>Opportunity to reinforce Tribeca Film Festival’s value of belonging to the community and local businesses.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
        <h2>Insight 3:</h2>
        <p>The Tribeca Family Festival was a way to give exposure and business to vendors, attracting over 300,000 people just two years ago in 2015. The discontinuation of it takes away this opportunity for businesses to showcase themselves and establish a meaningful connection with the community.</p>

        <!-- <h2>Potential Proposal:</h2>
        <img src="img/proto.png" alt="prototype" />
        <p>Prior to our final concept, we had a proposal of creating an extension to the existing Tribeca Film Festival application where it will utilize audio to create a cohesive experience for solo film enthusiasts to enhance their experience as they transition from one venue to another.</p>

        <p>However, because we focused on tying together Tribeca’s community and their original mission of revitalizing the Lower Manhattan community, we decided to opt away from this proposal.</p> -->

			<section class="section">
        <p>From researching Tribeca, there is currently no support that provides them with local information during the festival. This created an opportunity in building a stronger relationship between Tribeca Film Festival and the local businesses by targeting casual film goers during the pre-event stage</p>

			<section class="section">
        <p>I sketched out the placement of our extension on their pre-existing navigation page, which led to the filter screen where the users can choose from themes and activies </p>
        <p>This then led to the list of vendor information, where they can browse through the history of the selected vendor  </p>
        <!-- <img src="img/trib_wire.jpg" alt="tribeca wireframe" />
        <p>These are the preliminary stages of the wireframes for the landing screen, the explore filter screen and the shop's information page </p> -->

        <h2>Precedents:</h2>
        <p>In order to keep on brand with Tribeca's design aesthetic, their web design layout was implemented into our mobile proposal</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Role:</h2>
        <p>In order to make this extension blend into their existing application, I proposed the placement of having it on their Landing Navigation page. This way, the users will know that it is a primary feature within the app.</p>

        <p>I took on the role of researching what already exists within Tribeca's application, and utilized what they have already implemented.</p>

        <p>The Themes and Activities genres are based off of existing Tribeca Film Festival filters and terminology, to allow a sense of familiarity and to reduce cognitive overhead for the users.</p>

        <p>To re-introduce the local businesses, I curated a list of local business through the Tribeca Alliance. When the user selects the store page, they will see history about the store and the founder, to highlight their rich history within the Tribeca community.</p>

        <h2>Perceived Values</h2>
        <p>Through the proposed extension, Tribeca  Film Festival will be able to gain differentiation through leveraging their value of belonging to the community. It will decrease cognitive overhead for the overwhelmed attendees, and provide exposure to the local businesses that have been shaping the Tribeca community, bringing character back to the neighbourhood.</p>
